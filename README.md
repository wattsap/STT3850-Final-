This is a directory of helpful study tools, with the hope that it will allow us to pass the Statistics 3850 final at Appalachian State. The Index page is finalexam.html, built by finalexam.rmd. Everything else is an html link, so if you need to change something it needs to be done in the rmd file corresponding to the html file you would like to change, then the rmd file needs to be rebuilt. Thanks!
